1. wait -- let the LLM set a timer, either in the
    - background, so it can work on group 1 tasks, then pivot to group 2 tasks when the timer is up. 
    - foreground, so it can pause all thinking until an event wakes it up.
2. record -- to be used in conjunction with wait.
    - instruct the model to 'record' a given process' state for a specified period of time or until a predefined event occurs
